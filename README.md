# LotusCalculator
Calculator inspired by Lotus Flower.

I made the concept of this calculator as part of the DailyUI Design Challenge. I liked it so much and decided to code and make it work as a web app.

Check the result on [Lotus Calculator](http://wansoul.github.io/LotusCalculator).

You can see a video showing how should be the interaction. Some details I simplified in implementation for agility sake.
